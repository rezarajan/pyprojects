    "Deque Rotation\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that accepts a deque and an integer, n\n",
    "\n",
    "    It should then rotate the contents of the deque by n steps to the right\n",
    "    If n is negative, it should rotate it to the left\n",
    "    Do not use the built-in rotate functions/methods\n",
    "    You may write your own deque class, use the one from the dsa module (dsa.deque) or use the standard Python deque \n",
    "\n",
    "    Links to an external site.\n",
    "    Provide the Big O time complexity for both the average and worst-case scenarios\n",
    "    Provide the Big O space complexity, considering only the additional space required beyond the input\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and 2 -> [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]\n",
    "    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and -1 -> [2, 3, 4, 5, 1]\n",

    "Reverse a Queue\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that accepts a queue and reverses its contents. It should only use a queue data structure and recursion to reverse the queue in place.\n",

    "Recursive Binary Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a recursive binary search function to search for an element in an array. Assume the elements in the array are sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should return the index of the element and return -1 if it is not found.\n",

    "Balanced Brackets\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that returns a Boolean indicating whether a string has balanced brackets. You may ignore non-bracket characters. For our purposes, the following are bracket characters:\n",
    "\n",
    "(){}[]\n",
    "\n",
    "Balanced brackets refer to a string where every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and the pairs are properly nested.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, this function should return True for the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "[ ]\n",
    "{}{}[]()\n",
    "[{()}]\n",
    "(()[[[()({})]]])\n",
    "\n",
    "It should return False for the following:\n",

    "Postfix Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function to evaluate an arithmetic expression in string format. The expression is in postfix notation. This means that:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Also known as Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), operators follow their operands\n",
    "    Example: The infix expression 3 + 4 is written as 3 4 + in postfix notation\n",
    "    Each operator follows its two operands\n",
    "    No Parentheses Needed: Postfix notation eliminates the need for parentheses to indicate operation precedence\n",
    "    The order of operations is strictly defined by the position of operators and operands\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The strings are syntactically correct\n",
    "    Operands and operators are separated by spaces\n",
    "    The function should handle the operators +, -, *, and /\n",
    "    Numbers can be integers or floating-points\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: \"3 4 +\" Output: 7.0\n",
    "    Input: \"10 2 /\" Output: 5.0\n",
    "    Input: \"3 2 + 2 /\" Output: 2.5\n",
    "    Input: \"5 1 2 + 4 * + 3 -\" Output: 14.0\n",
    "        Evaluation steps:\n",
    "            5 1 2 + 4 * + 3 -\n",
    "            5 3 4 * + 3 -\n",
    "            5 12 + 3 -\n",
