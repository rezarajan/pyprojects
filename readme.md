## Project List

| Project Name | Learning Objectives | Description |
|--------------|------|-------------|
| [Poisson](./poisson/) | uv (project management), pytest | A small library for Poisson distribution utilities. Project managed using the uv tool. |
| [Algorithms](./algorithms/) | uv (project management), pytest, make, O-Notation Analysis, Python Generics| A small library for common search algorithms. Use pytest for more structured tests. Make used to manage commands. Time complexity analysis in O-Notation. |
| [Data Structures](./data_structures/) | O-Notation Analysis, Python Generics, Data Structures | A small library for common data structures. Includes read, insert, delet and search functionality. Generics used to ensure robustness; typing used to provide better static code analysis. |
| [UC Berkely Extension - DSA Assignments](./dsa_assignments/) | Data Structures and Algorithms in Python | Python coding assignments for the UC Berkely DSA Extension Course |
